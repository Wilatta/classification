# Neural Network for classification
## Guess the number game

**Introduction** 

This projet is a simple neural network who can guess the number from a loaded database and give the number who's the best.
The goal of this project is to make a code who follow the Software Requirements Specification build with the client.

The operating environment is Windows 10 updated and Python. 

**Setup the environnement**

1. Download Python 3.7.6 on your computer.
[Quick link here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
>- Go to https://www.anaconda.com/download/
>- Download Anaconda Python 3.7 version for Windows
>- Run the downloaded executable (.exe) file to begin the installation. See here for more details.
>- (Optional) In the next step, check the box “Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable”. This will make Anaconda your default Python distribution, which should ensure that you have the same default Python distribution across all editors.


2. Install TensorFlow 2 in your python environment.

Open your python terminal from Anaconda window.
```
pip install keras
```
[Keras documentation](https://keras.io/#getting-started-30-seconds-to-keras)

3. Install Numpy in your python environment.
```
python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose
```
[Numpy documentation](https://numpy.org/)

4. Install MNE in your python environment.

*Now you have installed everything you need*

You can run our software.
